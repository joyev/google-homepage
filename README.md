Very first project, just went through Basic HTML & CSS. finding it really hard to grasp but keen on the learning experience.

Just did my very own pull and unsure on how it went.

Looks like everything worked out fine. Keen to see how my progress went, will update after my first project

Commenting: Opened up VSCode using "code README.md"

Had issues and did a whole new repository

Done
